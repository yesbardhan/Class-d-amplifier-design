A Class-D amplifier, also known as a switching amplifier, is a highly efficient audio power amplifier that converts an input analog signal into a high-frequency pulse-width modulated (PWM) waveform. This PWM signal drives power MOSFETs that switch between on and off states, significantly reducing power loss compared to traditional linear amplifiers (Class-A, B, or AB). The switched output is then filtered using an LC low-pass network to reconstruct the amplified analog signal suitable for driving a speaker. In this project, we design a discrete Class-D amplifier using simple components—such as the NE555 timer IC, operational amplifiers, transistors, and passive components—without relying on any dedicated Class-D amplifier ICs. The complete design process covers component selection, circuit design, simulation, PCB layout, and documentation. Using open-source tools like KiCad for PCB design and Ngspice for simulation, the project demonstrates the practical implementation of an efficient, low-cost audio amplifier suitable for educational and hobby applications.# Class-d-amplifier-design
